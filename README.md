## Introduction

A Pong clone written with the [brute](https://www.github.com/markmandel/brute) Entity Component System library, and [play-clj](https://github.com/oakes/play-clj)

Currently only implements the desktop version, but have kept the stubs for iOS and android in case
I want to implement those as well at some stage.
